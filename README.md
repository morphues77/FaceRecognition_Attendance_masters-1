# FaceRecognition_Attendance_masters-1 🎯

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Python-based Face Recognition Attendance Tracker** designed to automate attendance management using computer vision. By leveraging **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and the **face_recognition** library, the system detects and recognizes faces in real-time and logs attendance into a database.  

The solution eliminates manual roll calls, improves accuracy, and provides a scalable approach for classrooms, offices, and events.

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition using webcam
- Automatic attendance logging with **name, date, and time**
- Integration with **CSV/SQLite database**
- Duplicate entry prevention
- Simple GUI displaying live feed and attendance status
- Modular and extensible Python codebase

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, face_recognition, SQLite3, Pandas  
- **Database:** CSV / SQLite  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Data Collection** – Capture and store facial images of individuals.  
2. **Face Encoding** – Convert facial features into numerical vectors.  
3. **Recognition** – Compare live camera input against stored encodings.  
4. **Attendance Logging** – Mark attendance automatically in CSV/SQLite.  
5. **Visualization** – Display live feed with recognition status.
